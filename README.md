This repo is an effort to create a cross-platform version of the RECAP extension. 
It uses the Open Forge library that can build multiple extensions from a common source, 
but alas, it was never compeleted by its author. 

The current status of this project is *experimental*. An IE plugin can be built using 
this code that is able to inject RECAP icons into PACER, thus saving users money, but
it is not able to upload new items to RECAP.

Continuation of this project would open up a new world of RECAP users since many law
firms use OLD technology. We're hopeful but pessimistic that MS's new browser, Spartan
will make us look back at this repository and think of the bad old days. But...maybe
Spartan won't solve any problems at all.
